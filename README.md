# cmuPathfinding

Pathfinding was a project created in around 24 hours during the CMU 15-112 Hackathon.

Our project has 2 parts: 
1. a pathfinding algorithm that finds the fastest path between 2 points on campus
2. a factory that allows the user to create a node map on any 2d image of a map.

cmu_112_graphics needs to be installed to run the program.
To run the pathfinder algorithm, simply run Pathfinder.py.
cmunodes.txt will contain all of the nodes necessary to path through cmu campus. If you want
to use cmu nodes for cmunodes.txt, please rename cmunodes.txt to nodes.txt.
If you would like to create your own nodes and nodes.txt already exists, either rename nodes.txt
to another name or delete nodes txt before running the factory.py file.
