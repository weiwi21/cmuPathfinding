Our project has 2 parts: 
1. a pathfinding algorithm that finds the fastest path between 2 points on campus
2. a factory that allows the user to create a node map on any 2d image of a map.

cmu_112_graphics needs to be installed to run the program.
To run the pathfinder algorithm, simply run Pathfinder.py.
cmunodes.txt contains all of the nodes necessary to path through cmu campus. If you want
to use cmu nodes for cmunodes.txt, please rename cmunodes.txt to nodes.txt. We are unable to take in
another file as an input due to the restrictions of the cmu_112_graphics and the inputs that it can take
If you would like to create your own nodes and nodes.txt already exists, either rename nodes.txt
to another name or delete nodes txt before running the factory.py file.
